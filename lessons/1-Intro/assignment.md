# Game Jam

Games are an area that have been heavily influence by developments in AI and ML. In this assignment, write a short paper on a game that you like that has been influenced by the evolution of AI. It should be an old enough game to have been influenced by several types of computer processing systems. A good example is Chess or Go, but also take a look at video games like pong or Pac-Man. Write an essay that discusses the game's past, present, and AI future.

### Response
I decided to look up what ventures AI has had with Pac-Man.
If you're unfamiliar with Pac-Man, it's a video game made in the 80s and comes from the same era of games like Galaga, Super Mario Bros, Tetris, and others. It's a simple game, you play as Pac-Man, a little yellow circle with a triangle partially cut out, and you eat pellets and other items for points or power ups. While you're doing this, you're also trying to avoid running into the ghosts, Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde. The movement of the ghosts is dictated by which personality it is.
When I checked online to see what AI has played Pac-Man, I found something more interesting than that from Nvidia, a company primarily known for amazing computer graphics cards. I found that back in 2020, Nvidia's AI recreated Pac-Man from just watching it being played. It was given controller input as well, but with just those two things the AI managed to just about nail the game. Of course, there's a few kinks and quirks such as the ghost behvaior being different or the overall graphics quality of the game being lower, but nonetheless it's a very impressive feat. This kind of feat isn't just useful for the virtual world, but in due time could prove to help create structures in the real world as well.
